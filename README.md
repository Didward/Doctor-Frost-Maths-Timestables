Welcome to the Doctor Frost Maths Timestables tool! This is a cool tool designed to help you practice your timestables that I accidentally created when tinkering about. Please follow the instructions below to use it effectively.

## How to Use
1. Open the Doctor Frost Maths Timestable Practice website.
2. Once the website is open, access the web developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I`.
3. In the web developer tools, navigate to the "Console" tab.
4. Copy the entire content of the `automate.js` file.
5. Paste the copied code into the console of the web developer tools.

Please remember the following:

- **Do not cheat!** This tool is intended to be used for legitimate practice and learning purposes only.
- Pressing any key will automatically fill in the answer for you. However, it's important to make a genuine attempt to solve the timestable questions on your own before using this tool.
- Have fun while using this tool, but always remember the importance of honest learning and effort.

That's it! Enjoy your timestable practice with the Doctor Frost Maths Timestables tool. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to ask for assistance. Happy learning!
